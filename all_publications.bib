	abstract = {We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.}

 ISSN = {00380431},

 abstract = {Arbitrarily selected individuals (N=296) in Nebraska and Boston are asked to generate acquaintance chains to a target person in Massachusetts, employing "the small world method" (Milgram, 1967). Sixty-four chains reach the target person. Within this group the mean number of intermediaries between starters and targets is 5.2. Boston starting chains reach the target person with fewer intermediaries than those starting in Nebraska; subpopulations in the Nebraska group do not differ among themselves. The funneling of chains through sociometric "stars" is noted, with 48 per cent of the chains passing through three persons before reaching the target. Applications of the method to studies of large scale social structure are discussed.},

abstract = {GitHub is a worldwide popular website for version control and source code management. In addition, since its users can follow each other, it also forms a professional social network of millions of users. In this work, we perform a data-driven study for analyzing the GitHub network. By introducing a distributed crawling framework, we first collect profiles and behavioral data of more than 2 million GitHub users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest and latest public dataset of GitHub. Then, we build the social graph of these users and conduct a thorough analysis of the network structure. Moreover, we investigate the user behavior patterns, particularly the patterns of the "commit" activities. Finally, we utilize machine learning methods to discover important users in the network with a high accuracy and a low overhead. Our inspiring findings are helpful for GitHub to provide better services for its users.},
